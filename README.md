Project: 07_JPA_entity_code

Project Description:

Using Hibernate and JPA, change all objects (Product and Customer) in previous app to JPA Entities and Persist them in a Database. 

Here I had to use the Spring boot starter data Jpa and h2 libraries in order to work with the previous classes I set up and annotate them as Entities
and giving a variable within the class the ID annotation which means it is used as a Primary Key. 

I also added a variable to the classes called "Version" and gave it the Version Annotation in order to prevent the chance of errors by enabling Optimistic Locking.
