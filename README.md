Project: 06_Spring Model View Controller

Project Description:

Design a program that handles a list of products and a list of customers using a MVC framework. 
This program allows users on a webpage to view, delete, add, edit and repopulate from a persistance store both product and customer objects using get and post actions.

The Layouts are created using thymeleaf and BootstrapCSS. 

I used JUnit and Mockito to create test for methods throughout the project's controllers.

The coding excercise for this project was to create all the code pretaining to the Customer functions of the application.
