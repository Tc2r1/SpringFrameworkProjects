Project: 03_di_factory_beans

Project Description: Dependency Injection using a wired factory pattern into the spring configuration. 

I create a factory bean that holds the configuration of the factory. 
Any dependent object that needs an object from that factory will get an injection of that factory bean and then call a method on that bean.
